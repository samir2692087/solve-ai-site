      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Solve AI (“we”, “our”, “us”) is a calculator and utility application that provides
        scientific calculations, GST calculations, EMI/loan calculations, currency conversion,
        unit conversion, age calculation, calculation history and AI-assisted problem solving
        using text, voice, and images.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling any information we process in a
        safe and transparent way.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Solve AI is designed to collect only the minimum information required for the app to
        function. We do <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account or provide your name,
        email address, phone number, or similar personal details.
      </p>

      <p><strong>a) Calculator, Converters &amp; Tools</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Numbers or values you enter (for example, GST amounts, EMI values, units,
          currencies, dates of birth) are processed only on your device to calculate results.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not store or upload this information to our own servers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>b) AI Text Input</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you type a question or problem into the AI solver, your text is sent securely to a
          trusted third-party AI service provider for the sole purpose of generating a reply.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not store this text or link it to any personal identity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>c) Voice Input</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you use voice input, your speech is converted to text using a speech-to-text engine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Audio is processed temporarily for conversion and is not stored by us.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>d) Image Input</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you upload an image of a problem, the image is processed only to extract text or
          relevant details needed to solve the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Images are not stored by us, and are not used for identification, training, or
          advertising purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>e) Technical &amp; Diagnostic Data (Non-Personal)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>App version and basic device information (such as device model and OS version).</li>
        <li>Anonymous crash logs and performance data to help improve stability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Currency Conversion</h2>
      <p>
        The currency converter feature may use a third-party service to retrieve live exchange
        rates. Only the currency values and codes (for example, USD to INR) required for
        conversion are sent.
      </p>
      <p>
        No personal identity information is shared with this service, and we do not use this data
        to profile or track you.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Local Storage &amp; History</h2>
      <p>
        Certain data, such as your calculation history, may be stored locally on your device so
        that you can review past calculations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This history is stored only on your device and is not uploaded to our servers.</li>
        <li>
          You can clear this data at any time using options in your device or app settings.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information described above only to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide calculator and conversion results.</li>
        <li>Generate AI-based answers from your questions.</li>
        <li>Process voice and image inputs into usable text.</li>
        <li>Improve app performance, reliability, and stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We <strong>do not</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sell your data to third parties.</li>
        <li>Use your data for advertising or marketing.</li>
        <li>Build personal profiles or track you across other apps and services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Solve AI does not knowingly collect personal data from children. Because the app does not
        require sign-up or personal identity information, it is designed to minimize the amount of
        data collected from all users, including children.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update
        the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this
        Privacy Policy periodically.
      </p>
